Binch Press works to create a supportive informal working and learning space. We are a cooperative of queer/trans folks and POC who share a printshop and ceramics studio in Central Falls, Rhode Island. We work to center artists whose identities intersect with multiple axes of marginalization, including class, disability, mental illness, race, age, religion, immigration status, indigeneity, gender/sexuality, carceral history, and experiences of violence/trauma. Binch Press strives to challenge the barriers to access put up by traditional art institutions and exclusive artists collectives alike.
