Binch Press is a volunteer-run print and ceramics cooperative centering queer/trans artists and artists of color in Providence, RI (occupied Pokanoket Wampanoag and Narragansett land). The group got its start in April 2018 when Dailen Williams assembled a working group of queer/trans artists with the intent of founding a printshop and fabrication studio in or around Providence. Now, we are sharing a studio in the heart of Providence with [Queer.Archive.Work](http://queer.archive.work) and accepting [applications for new studio members!](http://tinyurl.com/binchqawapp)
