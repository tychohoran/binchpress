Binch Press is a volunteer-run print and ceramics cooperative centering queer/trans artists and artists of color in Central Falls, RI (occupied Pokanoket Wampanoag and Narragansett land). The group got its start in April 2018 when Dailen Williams assembled a working group of queer/trans artists with the intent of founding a printshop and fabrication studio in or around Providence. In October, we signed a lease on a ~2100 sqft industrial space in Central Falls. With the help of countless volunteers and generous donors, we spent the next year building out the studio. We built walls, installed plumbing, and sourced equipment. Now we are accepting new members, taking jobs, and planning our 2020 programing.
