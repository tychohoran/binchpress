Binch Press is a volunteer-run print and ceramics cooperative centering queer/trans artists and artists of color in Central Falls, RI (occupied Pokanoket Wampanoag and Narragansett land). The group got its start in April 2018 when Dailen Williams assembled a working group of queer/trans artists with the intent of founding a printshop and fabrication studio in or around Providence. In October, we signed a lease on a ~2100 sqft industrial space in Central Falls. With the help of countless volunteers and generous donors, we spent the next six months building out the studio. We built walls, installed plumbing, and sourced equipment. Simultaneously, the collective laid the groundwork for Binch Pressâ€™s mission and cooperative structure. On April 5th, 2019, Binch Press celebrated its grand opening. The co-op hosted workshops and open studio days in following months, gradually inviting the public in and taking on 2 new members, bringing us to a total of 9 artists.
